# Metal Gear Solid Quake

## What is this mod?
This mod aims to recreate Metal Gear mechanics in Quake 4. In this mod, the player will have to complete three objectives in the level. Those three objectives are to eliminate a high-priority target, steal a rocket launcher, and hack a computer terminal (looks like a floating box in-game). After the player completes these tasks, the game will close, signifying victory.

## Features Added
- All weapons are Metal Gear themed
- A silenced blaster that enemies won't hear when shot
- When the player is crouched, enemies wonâ€™t hear the player
- 3 objectives for the player to complete
